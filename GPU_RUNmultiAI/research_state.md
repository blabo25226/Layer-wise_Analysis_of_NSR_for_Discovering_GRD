    integration_commit: 47d7459
    result: four C0001 evidence and preregistration draft artifacts persisted
open_findings:
  - Eight pre-existing GPU_RUN5 worktree records are prunable; they are unrelated to C0000 and were left untouched.
  - Gemini headless filesystem access soft-denies read_file/ListDir and can exit 0 without producing an artifact.
  - Claude critic raised a possible rescaling/exact-skeleton non-invariance; an exploratory algebraically equivalent formula check reproduced a false negative, but the actual pipeline round-trip remains untested.
  - Direct `.ai/workers/cursor.sh --write` launch rejected by cached policy in pre-reload Codex session; bash wrapper fallback used for C0001-INFRA-T002.

retries:
  C0000-T003: 1

next_action: >
  Run C0001-T005 in its isolated Cursor worktree using the independent review packet, then obtain an independent Claude
  closure before PI freeze. Do not inspect GPU_RUN5 sealed-test raw artifacts.

## Notes

- `C0000` is infrastructure/bootstrap only, not a scientific result cycle.
- Use `observed_commit`, `base_commit`, and verified `remote_commit` instead of a self-referential `commit` field.
- Reconstruction must reclassify stale `running` tasks using branch, worktree, artifact, and acceptance evidence.
- Active task entries follow `.agent/schemas/task-handoff-schema.md`.
